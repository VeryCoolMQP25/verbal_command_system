Unity Hall is a state-of-the-art academic and research facility fosters and enhances interdisciplinary connections and collaboration across campus. Unity Hall provides a base for a community of WPI faculty, researchers, and students focused on the connected world to come together along with partners from industry, government, and academia to develop integrated solutions with computational methods and smart design to some of the world's most pressing problems in health, energy, transportation, and the built environment. Unity Hall also improves navigation and accessibility from Boynton Street to the top of the hill, helping to create strong, direct connections between WPI's main campus, its eastern residential area, and its academic programs and centers at Gateway Park.

Unity Hall is an academic research building focused on computational-based technologies for the Fourth Industrial Revolution, including robotics, data science, bioinformatics, and computational biology. The success of Unity Hall lies in its ability to forge connections both physically between WPI's upper main campus and residential lower campus, as well as collaboratively between academic disciplines. Gensler, an architectural firm, aimed not only to meet the Institute's current needs, but also to seamlessly adapt to new pedagogical approaches. Column-free spaces, as well as interchangeable module rooms, ensure that swapping a room's functionality will be easy as populations and needs change.

Unity Hall is a new five-story academic and research building that supports programs for architecture/engineering, cybersecurity, data science, computer science, learning science, Bioinformatics & Computational Biology (BCB) and robotics research labs. The upper two floors consist of seven active learning classrooms as well as the Academic Resources Center, Career Development Center, Academic Advising and Disability Services. This state-of-the-art facility supports WPI's commitment to preparing students for long-term success in today's evolving technological world and provides space for "smart world" research collaboration and integrated student academic services while improving campus accessibility. Unity Hall is comprised of a steel superstructure with concrete slabs on deck with a brick and curtain wall facade. Construction required cutting, capping and relocating existing underground utilities that were located within the footprint of Unity Hall. Excavation for new foundations, and general site prep for new construction involved digging into the side of a hill requiring support of excavation for earth retention. Unity Hall is built to LEED Gold certification with sustainable features including a rainwater reuse tank and infiltration system.

WPI's Unity Hall is a 100,000-square-foot, state-of-the-art academic and research facility. With classrooms, labs, lounge areas, and other versatile learning spaces as well as faculty and administrative offices, Unity Hall was built for WPI faculty, researchers, and students to learn, educate, and collaborate. Creative Office Resources and Gensler worked together to plan, coordinate, and carry out the project from beginning to end, including furniture and finish selections, value engineering, installation services, and more.

Unity hall has 5 floors, and there are 252 stairs in the building. It was built in 2022, making it the newest building on WPI's campus.

The first floor of Unity Hall consists of robotics labs, MQP spaces, and a laser cutting room.

The second floor of Unity Hall consists of the robotics professors' offices, an architectural studio, an IMGD lab, and robotics labs.

The third floor of Unity Hall has the data science research lab, offices, and study spaces.

The fourth floor of Unity Hall has the bioinformatics and computational biology lab, the registrar's office, active learning classrooms, and professors' offices.

The fifth floor of Unity Hall consists of the Career Development Center, Academic Resources Center, and classrooms.
